# **AI Foundations Assignment: Evaluating ChatGPT as a Data Tutor**

## **Objective**  
This assignment aims to help students critically evaluate the effectiveness of using ChatGPT as a data tutor by analyzing its responses, comparing it to Google, and understanding when to use each resource for problem-solving. You will use your spreadsheet and pivot tables from your course pre-work to complete this assignment.

## **Instructions**

### 1. **Introduction**  
Write a short paragraph below describing the role of AI tools like ChatGPT in learning data analytics. Include your expectations for how ChatGPT can assist in your learning process.

I believe that ChatGPT is an incredible tool/resource when it comes to learning data analytics. It can provide real-world examples pulled from a number of online sources very similar to a search engine like Google. Of course, it’s important to keep in mind that AI is still very much a new tool and its answers should be taken lightly. Regarding my learning, I expect it to be useful in generating images (i.e. charts and dashboards) that can inspire me on how to create my own charts and dashboards. Additionally, I believe it will be useful in providing immediate responses to data-related questions pulled from a few sources that can help me in a pinch when reviewing my incorrect answers on a quiz or assignment in order to help retain information.

### 2. **Data Task: Sorting in Pivot Charts**  

You will ask ChatGPT the following question:  
**_"How do you sort the values in a pivot chart by descending order in Excel?"_** (or Google Sheets if that is what you are using) 

- **a. Ask ChatGPT:**  
  - Screenshot ChatGPT's response and include below. 
  - Implement the instructions provided by ChatGPT in Excel or Google Sheets to test if they work.

- **b. Analysis:**  
  - Evaluate the response: Was the explanation clear? Did the steps work? Were there any errors or missing steps?  
  - Suggest how the explanation could be improved, if necessary.
 
    This is my idea about this....

The explanation was clear and the steps were accurate until step 3b (where it says “From the Context Menu, choose Sort”). The only sort options in the context menu sorted the way that the data fields appeared in the context menu itself rather than the PivotTable. In the end, I ended up figuring out how to sort the data myself. I selected the row of data and went to the Home tab <   <  Sort Smallest to Largest. I do wish that ChatGPT’s instructions had been more specific and offered more than one way to sort the data. It could definitely improve by providing more methods to achieve one solution and providing its sources somewhere on the page so that users can access it directly if needed.

### 3. **Comparison**  
- Use Google to search for the same solution (e.g., "sort pivot chart by descending order in Excel").  
- Compare the Google search experience to ChatGPT’s response:  
  - Was the Google result more or less detailed?  
  - Did you find videos, articles, or blog posts helpful?  
  - Include any relevant link(s) you found helpful and explain why.

The Google result was more detailed than ChatGPT’s result. I didn’t need to figure out the solution on my own with Google’s result. Google’s result did offer resources in different formats (articles, ai instant response, video, etc.) which was helpful. The most helpful link was the one to the article on Microsoft Support’s website (Sort data in a PivotTable or PivotChart - Microsoft Support) because that page offers instructions that are clear and concise. It’s also from the creator of the software, so the instructions can’t be more specific.

### 4. **Pick Another Scenario*  
- Ask ChatGPT another data question as it relates to how to do something in excel/google sheets 
- Which resource you found most effective for this?

The instructions were actually incredibly clear and helpful this time. My question was how to create Macros in Excel and the instructions that ChatGPT provided were excellent. I was able to create a Macro without any issues or external resources needed. In this case, ChatGPT was the most helpful resource.

### 5. **When to Use Which Resource**  
Write a short response below explaining when it would be appropriate to use ChatGPT or Google. Consider factors like:  
- Time sensitivity  
- Complexity of the problem  
- Need for detailed visual instructions  
- Level of confidence in verifying the accuracy of the information  

Both Google and ChatGPT are incredible resources. I definitely prefer Google for time-sensitive tasks, simply because it gives me access to a number of resources in different formats immediately, whereas ChatGPT only provides a few. For complex questions, I think ChatGpt has more potential than Google because its ability to break down a complex idea into something digestible from a few sources is better than Google’s. For questions that require detailed visual instructions, I think Google is ideal compared to ChatGPT because of its multimedia tabs that are well-known and user-friendly. I’ve also noticed that some google results are in video form, which I think is helpful. I feel more confident in verifying information accuracy with Google rather than ChatGPT simply because it’s been around longer and (in many cases) pulls information from reputable sources that are easy to access. ChatGPT needs more time and training to establish credibility as a reliable tool.

### 6. **Final Reflection**  
Reflect on your experience using ChatGPT vs Google and describe:  
- Which resource you found most effective for this task and why.  
- How this exercise influenced your approach to learning new data skills in the future.  

Overall, I had a positive experience using both tools, Google and ChatGPT. The lack of clarity in ChatGPT’s answer to my first Excel question made me question its reputability, though (even though its answer to my second Excel question was much better). All in all, I think Google is a more effective tool for researching answers to questions because of its ability to pull up several resources (with links) in multimedia formats, giving the user more variety to choose from. I will definitely use Google as a primary tool for researching answers (because of my reason listed above) but keep ChatGPT in mind as a potential secondary tool, as I feel that its breakdown of complex topics is excellent.
